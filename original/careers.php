                                        <p>Credit unions are safe and sound places to bank. Every credit union is regulated and examined consistently by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) - the U.S. government agency - or a state credit union government agency, ensuring the safety and soundness of its operations. And, just like the FDIC, the NCUA insures credit union deposits up to at least $250,000.</p>
