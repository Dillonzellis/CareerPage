                    intelligent, passionate people I get to work with. I also
                    enjoy working in a company that is growing and always
                    provides more career opportunities. LSCU offers great
                    benefits that help the employee to feel rewarded for the
                    good job that they do."

                    make a difference. I believe in our core values and what we
                    represent as an organization. Understanding my role as the
                    Facilities Manager is significant because of my
                    responsibility to ensure a safe, secure, and productive
                    environment for our team members, so that they can work hard
